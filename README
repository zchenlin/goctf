goCTF

If you want to build goCTF from source, see below.

1. Check dependencies

goCTF has several dependencies:
* wxWidgets >= 3.0
* Either FFTW or Intel's Math Kernel Library (MKL)
* zlib
* LibTIFF
* GNU Scientific Library (GSL) >= 2.5

1.1 wxWidgets

To check that you have wxWidgets installed, do:

$ which wx-config

To check you have the correct version of wxWidgets, do:

$ wx-config --version

If you have several versions of wxWidgets installed, you may have to do e.g.:

$ wx-config-3.0 --version

or:

$ /path/to/wx-config --version

and add the following flag to your configure line:
--with-wx-config=/path/to/wx-config-3.0


1.2 Intel's Math Kernel Library (MKL)

If it is available on your system, the configure script should detect Intel's 
Math Kernel Library (MKL) and ensure that the program will be linked against 
it. This is preferred as it gives a significant performance boost.


1.3 FFTW

If the MKL is not available, you need to ensure FFTW is installed.

1.4 zlib

This is needed by libtiff for handling compressed files.
You may need to specify where the zlib files are installed on your system
using the following configure line:
--with-zlib-dir=/path/to/zlib/install

1.5 LibTIFF

This library is needed to enable reading and/or writing TIFF files.
You may need to specify where the LibTIFF files are installed on your system
using the following configure option:
--with-libtiff-dir=/path/to/libtiff/install

1.6 GNU Scientific Library (GSL)

To check if you have GSL installed, do:

$ gsl-config

To ensure you have the proper version of GSL, do:

$ gsl-config --version



2. Configure

See configure --help for details of available options. 

For optimal performance, we recommend: --disable-debugmode --enable-mkl



3. Build and install

The recommended way to build and install goCTF is below.

$ cd /path/to/uncompressed/folder
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ ../configure [options]
$ make
$ make install
